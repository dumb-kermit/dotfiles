1. WELCOME

Welcome to this wonderful repo - a grand amalgamation of months of work, dedicated to finding (not) NEMO (not) -- THE PERFECT SETUP -- or as it stands, with a more tangible reason - the perfect setup for me...

...which, as we all know - does not exist. It is a true myth, and there is ALWAYS room for improvement, I mean, unless otherwise... you're not learning and not progressing, hence stagnation and shameful death... anyway, yeah, no setup is perfect and in a week or two I am bound to tweak something here and there -- that is normal, I learn, I improve -- I get to need better tools, I get to know how to use better setups etc.


2. GOALS

The goal is -- to get to the point, where it is just 'good enough' that I feel like it is OKAY to leave out any minor tweaks 'for now' and focus on actual work and studying - so basically, a setup that is good enough, that until I get to a next milestone in my coding adventure -- it's good to serve me well, in fact right now, it is up to the point of complete satisfaction and even more, I damn love this setup, lol <3

Anyways, enjoy. 


3. CONTENT

You will find here:

1. Kitty config -- with basic opts and keybinds -- I use -- https://github.com/Raghav-rv28/kitty-sesh -- for session management. Including custom colorscheme here.

2. Fish config -- very basic, just minor aliases and stuff. I use z for jumps on 'z' and fzf for everything with fpp for cd's -- hence aliases for that in the config. Also including custom colorscheme for that as well.

3. NVIM config -- complete package, just drop all the files from 'nvim' folder from the repo into your own ~/.config/nvim and let it sync up -- enjoy. I am using custom 'Moonbow' colorscheme and I love it so much (it's a banger, as if Ayu and Gruvbox had a baby lol) -- I've ported it to Kitty and Fish (both are included here in their respective folders).
     3.1 THE SETUP
         1. Completely functional LSP setup;
         2. Telescope setup with File Browser and IMAGE PREVIEWS inside (for Kitty, works only there);
         3. Autocompletions, suggestions, snippets, etc;
         4. Customized colorscheme to match the terminal & shell;
         5. Leap for advanced motions (jump inside the BUF with <CR>);
         6. Basic goodies, like autopairs, blank indent with animation, basic dashboard (with colourscheme picker, etc) -- all powered by mini, hehe;
         7. Basic autocmds, including couple of tweaks made for Leap (to make <CR> jumping work better for me) and some for Kitty (using dynamic padding feature, works with included config file);
